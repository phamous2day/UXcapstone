Applying Google Venture's "Sprint Methodology" to our 3-week project

## Day 0: Learning Sprint

* Teammate introduced us to "Sprint" book by Jake Knapp
* We have 3 weeks to work on project and wanted to compress our workflow via Sprint Methodology to "Fail fast, fail often" to "learn fast, learn often."
* We also came up with questions to ask our stakeholders. To do this, I thought about doing some research to be competent on the subject but as a team we figured it's best not to research ... this way, our questions would be purely unbiased because we truly aren't SME's in the diving field.

## Day 1: Meeting the Stakeholders

* Met with stakeholders to discuss the pain points and what they envision the ultimate goal to be: "to make an easy to use dive log tablet app"
* We got a workflow of how the current process goes: 
1. Getting tasks from the "Tender"
2. Then after divers are done, fill out dive logs into paper form, then into the computer.

* We then made a mind map of the problems and phrased them in the form of "how might we solve [insert problem]"
* Ended day with creating competitive analysis with similar tools
